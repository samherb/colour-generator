# Colour Generator

This project is a simple colour generator built with Nuxt 3 and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to generate a rainbow palette based on the number of colours entered. Users can click on any colour box to copy the colour code to the clipboard, with a tooltip indicating the successful copy.
